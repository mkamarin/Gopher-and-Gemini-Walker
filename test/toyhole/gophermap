A Gopher server exposes a directory structure to the network using
the gopher protocol (RFC 1436).  In that respect, it is similar to
FTP  (RFC 959).  The main  difference is that  Gopher  looks for a
‘gophermap’  file in a  directory.  If that file is present,  then
Gopher will use that  file as a menu for  the directory, otherwise
it will  just list the files  and  directories in  that directory.
Therefore a ‘gophermap’  is just a text file that serves as a menu
for a directory, but can also provide links to other resources.

A Gopher map has a very simple structure. Each line can have up to
four fields separated by horizontal tabs  (ASCII decimal 09 or hex
x09 or ‘\t’). With one exception, the first character of the first
field indicates the type of line. Therefore, a line looks like:
i	/
i    Label <TAB> selector <TAB> host <TAB> port	/

Where,

i    - Label should be human readable text.	/
i      The first character of the label is the line item type.	/
i    - selector is what the line is pointing to. 	/
i      The selector can be a file, a directory, etc.	/
i    - host refers to the host were the selector resides	/
i    - port is the port used Gopher in that host	/

The most common item types are:

i    '0’ for a file (normally text files)	/
i    '1’ for a directory	/
i    '9’ for binary files (for example, pdf, zip, etc.)	/
i    'g’ for GIF graphic files	/
i    'I’ for other image files (like jpg, png, etc.)	/
i    'h’ for HTML files. 	/
i    'i’ for informational messages.	/
i    's’ for sound files (like wav, etc.)	/

  If the selector is located in the host containing the gophermap,
then the host and port can be omitted.  Which is a  good practice,
because  then you can move the directory  structure to a different
host without changing any gophermaps.

A file or directory  selector that starts with ‘/’ is  relative to
the main directory  in  the  gopher site.  Otherwise,  the file or
directory is located in the same directory than the gophermap.

Lines with no tab:
1) Lines without any horizontal tabs are considered text and should
   be displayed as such by Gopher clients.

Lines with a single tab:
1) Lines staring with item type  ‘i’  should have a selector (so it
   will have one  <TAB>).  It  is  common  to  use  ‘/’  for such a
   selector.  It is  also common to omit  the host and port fields.
   Therefore only one tab is present on these lines.

An example of these type of lines is  the banner at the top of this
document, that uses the ‘i’ item type and ‘/’ as the selector. That
forces the gopher client to show the line exactly as it was created.

2) All other item types  can have the label and the selector fields
   only if they reside in the same  host as the gophermap.  In this
   case the host and port fields are optional.

Few examples are:
0A text file (relative to this gopgermap)	stuff/text.txt
9A pdf file (relative to the gopher site)	/stuff/a-file.pdf
Ian image file	stuff/image.jpg
1The stuff directory (relative to this gopgermap)	stuff
1The stuff directory (relative to the gopher site)	/stuff

Lines with three tabs:
1) Lines with a  selector that  resides in a  different host.  Must
   have the host and port fields. Therefore the URL for those lines
   becomes:  “gopher://<host>:<port><selector>”.  Note that in this
   case, the selector must start with a  ‘/’ and be relative to the
   hosting gopher site.

Few examples:
1The base directory of the SDF gopher site	/	sdf.org	70
1The Floodgap gopher site	/	gopher.floodgap.com	70

The exception are lines with item type of ‘h’. The selector in those
lines can start with “URL:” followed by a scheme (e.g. “URL:http://”,
or “URL:ftp://”, “URL:gopher://”, “URL:gemini//”, etc.). Note that in
this case the host and port fields are optional.

Few example:
hThe SDF web site	URL:http://sdf.org/
hThe Floodgap web site	URL:https://www.floodgap.com/
hOur sister toycapsule	URL:gemini://myserver/

This is basically all what you need to know to create gophermaps. It is
in good manners to keep most posts in a phlog as text files  (with .txt
extension), and use gophermaps to point to the posts. Or in some cases,
just write text  files in a suitable  directory structure and leave the
gopher server navigate the directory structure.
